/**
 * Cancellation support for apcore module execution.
 *
 * Spec D-18 (apcore v0.22.0): `cancel()` MUST be a real interrupt — not
 * merely a cooperative flag. In TypeScript this is realised by backing
 * `CancelToken` with an `AbortController`. The `signal` is exposed so it
 * can be composed (`AbortSignal.any([...])`) with timeout signals inside
 * `BuiltinExecute`, and so user modules performing standard Web-API I/O
 * (`fetch`, `setTimeout`, Web Streams) participate in real abort. The
 * cooperative `check()` and `isCancelled` accessors remain for modules
 * whose pause points are not Web APIs.

   * detached every consumer holding the pre-reset `signal`: a module that
   * had composed `ctx.cancelToken.signal` into an in-flight `fetch` saw
   * `aborted === false` forever after, so a `reset()` followed by a

   * true. `signal` is the D-18 real-abort channel that
   * `apcore/docs/features/async-tasks.md` makes normative for TypeScript
   * specifically, so silently detaching it was a real-abort failure, not a
   * cosmetic difference — and one invisible to cooperative checkers.
   *
   * The cost of keeping one controller is the half of peer parity that the
   * Web platform does not offer: **an `AbortSignal` cannot be un-aborted**.
   * After a cancel, the signal channel stays aborted for good. Cooperative
   * state ({@link isCancelled}, {@link check}, {@link raiseIfCancelled})
   * resets exactly as the peers do; signal-based consumers must construct a
   * new `CancelToken` rather than reuse a cancelled one, and are told so
   * once per token. Failing closed this way can only cancel work early —
   * the previous behaviour failed open and could not cancel it at all.
