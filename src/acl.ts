 * precedence, an operand is always a plain pattern string, and there is exactly
 * one operator position — index 0. `$or` / `$not` therefore have two different
 * grammars in this specification and only the one in `conditions` (§6.1.1)
 * nests. The set of legal shapes is closed:
 *
 *   1. the array MUST NOT be empty;
 *   2. every element MUST be a non-empty string;
 *   3. `$or` at index 0 MUST be followed by at least one pattern;
 *   4. `$not` at index 0 MUST be followed by exactly one pattern;
 *   5. `$or` / `$not` MUST NOT appear at any index other than 0.
 *
 * Everything outside that set can never match, so a rule carrying it is not a
 * narrow rule but no rule at all: through v1.30.0 all three SDKs returned
 * `false` from the matcher for `[]`, `['$or']` and `['$not']`, reading an arity
 * fault as a scope decision. On an `allow` rule that is merely useless; on a
 * `deny` rule under `defaultEffect: 'allow'` it is a **fail-open** — the call
 * the operator wrote the rule to block is permitted, by a rule that loaded
 * without error and a validator that called it clean. `['$not', p1, p2, …]` was
 * worse than inert: every SDK consulted `p1` and dropped the rest, so an
 * `allow` rule excluding two targets GRANTED the second one.
 *
 * The checks run most-basic-first — empty array, empty element, reserved token
 * out of position, operator arity — so the message names the fault an operator
 * has to fix first rather than a consequence of it.
 *
 * @param patterns - Already known to hold only strings. The element TYPE is
