/**
 * A `callers` / `targets` pattern array's SHAPE is closed, at every entry point
 * — PROTOCOL_SPEC §6.2.1 with §6.1.4.1 and §6.1.1 (spec v1.31.0, apcore#112).
 *
 * The defect this pins: a pattern array with no operands made the rule inert.
 * `[]`, `['$or']` and `['$not']` can never match, all three SDKs returned
 * `false` from the matcher, and `validateRules()` reported nothing — so the
 * decision tracked `defaultEffect` exactly and the rule contributed nothing. On
 * an `allow` rule that is merely useless. On a `deny` rule under
 * `defaultEffect: 'allow'` it is a **fail-open**: the call the operator wrote
 * the rule to block is permitted, by a rule that loaded without error and a
 * validator that called it clean. It was reachable from a plain YAML file,
 * because `ACL.load` rejected an *omitted* `callers` / `targets` and permitted
 * an *empty* one.
 *
 * Two more shapes ride along, argued in the same section. `['$not', p1, p2, …]`
 * was implementation-defined — consult `p1`, drop the rest — which every SDK
 * did, so an `allow` rule excluding two targets GRANTED the second: a silent
 * privilege escalation from a form the specification blessed. And a pattern
 * array is FLAT — the operators do not nest and there is no precedence, unlike
 * the same tokens in `conditions` — so a reserved token outside index 0 is
 * neither a nested operator nor a usable pattern.
 *
 * Two tiers, and they are not the same mechanism. TIER 1 is structural and is
 * rejected at every door. TIER 2 is semantic — well-formed and still matching
 * nothing — and is a `validateRules()` finding that changes no decision.
 *
 * Deliberately fixture-independent: these run on a checkout with no apcore spec
 * repo beside it. The cross-language contract lives in
 * `conformance/fixtures/acl_pattern_arity.json`, which lands only once all
 * three SDKs have.
