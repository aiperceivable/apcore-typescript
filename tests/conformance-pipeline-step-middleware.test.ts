/**
 * Cross-language conformance driver for `pipeline_step_middleware.json`
 * (Issue #33 §2.2 — the StepMiddleware lifecycle).
 *
 * Fixture source: apcore/conformance/fixtures/pipeline_step_middleware.json
 * (canonical). This file LOADS it. `tests/test-pipeline-step-middleware.test.ts`
 * is a hand-written unit test over the same area; a hand copy cannot notice
 * when the canonical fixture gains a case, which is why both exist and why only
 * this one counts as conformance coverage.
 *
 * The fixture's `driver_contract` names the ways this file is easy to write
 * vacuously, and all of them are avoided here:
 *
 *  - `order_is_the_assertion` — asserting the SET of invoked middlewares rather
 *    than the ORDERED list. A set passes against a straight-through
 *    implementation, which is exactly what the onion model exists to rule out.
 *  - `first_recovery_wins` — testing recovery with a single recovering handler.
 *    With one recovery, first-wins and last-wins yield the same value; the case
 *    must have two handlers that would BOTH recover.
 *  - `assert_the_wire_code` / `wrapper_is_load_bearing` — every error
 *    expectation is a WIRE CODE (`wrapper_error_code`, `original_error_code`),
 *    never a class name. Removing the `MiddlewareChainError` wrapping from the
 *    SDK was verified to leave this whole file GREEN before those codes were
 *    asserted; it is the single behaviour the `beforeStep` fix exists to
 *    provide, so it is now pinned.
 *  - `step_output_is_a_MUST` — the recovery value BECOMES the step's output
 *    (features/middleware-system.md → Normative Rules). apcore-typescript used
 *    to treat it as informational and leave `ctx.output` untouched, alone among
 *    the three SDKs; `expected.step_output` is now asserted against `ctx.output`.
 *  - `before_step_failure_is_terminal` — asserting only that an error was
 *    THROWN. An implementation that honours the `beforeStep` recovery and then
 *    happens to fail somewhere later satisfies a throw-only assertion while the
 *    authorization bypass is live, so `recovery_honored: false` is driven by
 *    observing that the FOLLOWING step never executed.
 *  - `two_recovery_paths` — the two recovery paths are deliberate opposites and
 *    MUST NOT share an implementation: a `beforeStep` failure discards the
 *    recovery and fires no `afterStep`; a recovered STEP BODY publishes the
 *    recovery and MUST still close the onion with `afterStep`.
 *  - `assert_the_exact_key_set` — asserting that one key is ABSENT from
 *    `state.outputs`. `not.toContain('second')` also passes against an
 *    implementation that lost `first` and against one that never populated the
 *    map at all, so the exact key set is asserted instead; and the three
 *    expectations differ on purpose, `onStepError` being observed on the THIRD
 *    step so that an all-empty map cannot satisfy them.
 *
 * `beforeStep(stepName, state)` is an OBSERVATION hook. A Step is
 * `execute(ctx)` and takes no inputs argument, so nothing it returns can reach
 * the module — the last case asserts precisely that.
